Snake and Ladder Game with Points-based Leaderboard (LLD + Implementation)

Project Objective

To design and implement a multiplayer Snake and Ladder game with a rules-based points system that powers a real-time leaderboard. The focus is on building a clean Low-Level Design (LLD), implementing OOP-based modular architecture, and integrating a competitive point-scoring mechanism

Key Features
Turn-based multiplayer Snake and Ladder game with dynamic board setup.
Object-oriented design with clean separation of concerns (Game, Player, Board, Dice, etc.).
Customizable scoring rules (+10 for ladders, -10 for snakes, etc.) that influence gameplay strategy.
Real-time score updates and a persistent leaderboard ranking players by performance.
Scalable and testable architecture with support for saving/loading leaderboard data.
Console-based interface for MVP, with optional upgrades to GUI or web-basedÂ frontends .
